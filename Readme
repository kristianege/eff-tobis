The folder contains all data files, scripts and packages used in the project data treatment.

Primarily this Report is ment as a runthrough of the data treatment, but by embedding the project R-scripts it both serves as a master document and complete documentation of entire R-project related to the otolith part of the KorTobis project.

The report itself can viewed by opening the "Project report.html" file in the project folder in your browser, or if in r-studio by opening the project and just clicking the file in the file browser.

You can extract alle the R code in the markdown document with by running:
